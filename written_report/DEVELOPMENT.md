# Weekly Development

## Nov 19 \~ Nov 26

Discussed in detail of division of labor. Designed and put in place the framework based on attributes of the data set.

* Special notes : One of our group mate, yunzew5, decided to go CR/NC for CS225. Thus he decided not to continue in this project.

### Meeting

On Nov 19th, we had a meeting to discuss the job allocation. We plan to first implement the frame of the graph in this week, then implement the advanced algorithms next week after our next meeting.

### Work Covered

Framework of the graph, basic functions related to graph, makefile files, some tests, ReadFromFile

## Nov 27 \~ Dec 3

We had a meeting to check the current work finished. We have finished the most of the algorithms, and the remaining work is to read in the datasets and one more algorithm.

### Meeting

On Dec 1st, we had a second meeting to discuss the further development of the project. We have finished the frame of the graph template and basic algorithms in the previous week. The remaining work is one uncovered algorithm and reading in the data in the dateset. We had a discussion about the work allocation for the remaining work.

### Work Covered

Framework of the graph, most of the algorithms and related tests.

## Dec 4 \~ Dec 10

### Meeting

We had meetings on Dec 4th, 6th, 7th. We had meetings to check the final development of the code, and we gather together to write our README and RESULTS. There will be two more meetings before the deadline to make presentations and make final check on our commited materials.

### Work Covered

Implementation of the sample, improvement of advanced algorithms, and more tests.
